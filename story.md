# Gridora Chronicles – The Sudoku System

In the digital world of Gridora, the entire city runs on puzzle energy.
Array Esha organizes the 9×9 matrix streets where every number belongs in a perfect order.
Stack Romaisa manages the City Archive, allowing past actions to be undone using her LIFO magic.
HashMap Natasha zooms through memory lanes, instantly retrieving clues to keep the system stable.

One day, the Great Sudoku Core started glitching, causing numbers to vanish and cells to scramble.
Array Esha quickly rearranged the messy grid.
Stack Romaisa stabilized the chaos by stacking every event into perfect order.
HashMap Natasha recovered the missing values with her lightning-fast lookup spells.

Together, they saved Gridora and restored the Sudoku System.
And from that day on, the city ran smoother than a bug-free codebase.
